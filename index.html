        <p> I am a really big fan of manga–which is basically a Japanese comic–and the best thing I have read as of late is called "I Want to Eat Your Pancreas" which I understand has the strangest title when put out of context but it is a heart-wrenching story. The plot of the story is about these two high-school kids. The boy is sort of an outcast and the other is a popular girl who many people look up to. The girl has a terminal illness (a pancreatic cancer) but no one knows except the outcast boy.</p>
        <p> It was a beautiful story about dealing with death and also living life to the fullest. It was existential and I definitely look at life a little bit differently after reading it. Needless to say I got emotional but nonetheless, it was definitely the best thing I've read recently. </p>
